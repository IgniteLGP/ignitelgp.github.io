					As Benjamin Franklin once said, time is money, and a shop owner does not want to lose track of his business and that is what Drag&Shop does. Drag&Shop is a multi-platform mobile application that makes sure that the user does not miss a thing, anytime or anywhere, because if the user for example misses a complaint from an important client, it could be costly.
				</p>

				<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
					This application is destined for two kinds of users, the shop owner the generic employee. The shop owner side of the app is more concentrated on statistics and management, and the employee side is more concentrated on order/product management. To get all the information needed to both the shop owner and the employee, the application is connected to external services that are being developed by teams at IT SECTOR, our client.
				</p>

				<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
					To be able to provide the application to a wide range of users, the application will be built using Ionic, a HTML mobile framework that allows us to build one single application that will work on either Android or iOS. This will make the application also really responsive to the user when getting data from the external services since Ionic uses Angular.js 2, a very robust front-end web framework.
